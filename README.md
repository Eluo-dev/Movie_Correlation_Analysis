Project task: Develop visuals to display what variables correlate most to movie gross earnings, scrape data from csv, show how data correlates using plots and heatmaps, sort and analyze the data and produce conclusion

Hypothesis: budget and company will be highly correlated with gross revenue, analyze the data to verify if this is true

Pycharm not displaying all csv data so I used Jupyter Notebook instead of Pycharm
